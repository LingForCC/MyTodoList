# Idea

We have got tons of Todo Apps in the marketplace. Most of them are built based on [GTD](https://gettingthingsdone.com) methodology. Though all of these Todo Apps are great tools, they still have got following weak points.

1. Not able to setup the connections between tasks
2. In lack of an innovative way to understand task priority
3. In lack of a platform which allows people to apply additional features or integration with

So this project is built aiming to find a solution to resolve aforementioned weak points.
